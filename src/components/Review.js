                    <p>What else can be said about the breathtaking scenery, difficult (yet doable) activities, gorgeous weather,
                        delectable food, and exceptional tour leaders and other travellers? This trip was fantastic. Sharing her
                        home and culture with us was a fantastic experience provided by our guide. Although we were highly active
                        and covered a lot of distance, the trip was stress-free and perfect in every way.</p>

                    <p>The trip with travel were fantastic with a great itinerary that allowed us to see and do many things in a
                        short time that I am sure I would not be able to do so efficiently on my own. It was also a great
                        opportunity to make new friends. The trips had great trip leaders as well, which made the trip more fun and
                        enjoyable and I didn't have to worry about anything but have a great time.</p>

                    <p>We have been to India 4 times previously, but nothing like this. We felt like 'insiders' with the local
                        knowledge and destinations we visited. The hiking was fabulous, the scenery exceptional and the food was
                        authentic and delicious. Our guides were top notch, taking care of every possible need and then some.</p>
